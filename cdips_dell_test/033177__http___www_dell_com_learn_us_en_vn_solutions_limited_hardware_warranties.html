Remote diagnosis may involve customer access to the inside of the product and multiple or extended sessions. If Dell determines that your issue is the result of a defect in materials or workmanship but the issue is not able to be resolved remotely, Dell, at its sole discretion, may dispatch a replacement part to you, arrange for you to send your product or defective part back to Dell's repair depot or replace the part or product with a comparable part or product that may be new or refurbished. If the Dell Limited Hardware Warranty for your product includes onsite/in-home warranty service, then Dell may also elect to dispatch a service technician to your location to perform the repair or replacement (see Important Information about Onsite/In-Home Warranty Service After Remote Diagnosis below).</p><p>If your limited hardware warranty has expired or if we determine that the problem is <strong>not</strong> covered under this limited hardware warranty, we may be able to offer you service alternatives on a fee basis.</p><p>We use new and refurbished parts made by various manufacturers in performing warranty repairs and in building replacement parts and products. Refurbished parts and products are parts or products that have been returned to Dell, some of which were never used by a customer. All parts and products are inspected and tested for quality. Replacement parts and products are covered for the remaining period of the limited hardware warranty for the product you purchased. Dell owns all parts removed from repaired products and, in most instances, you will be required to return defective parts to Dell.</p><p>Dell may use authorized representatives to provide any of the technical support or repair services under this limited hardware warranty.</p><p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Important information about returning products to Dell for repair or replacement:</span></b> </p><p><strong>For Mail-in Service: Customer supplies box, pays shipping:</strong> Upon a determination by Dell that your product should be returned to Dell for repair or replacement, we will issue a Return Material Authorization (RMA) number that you must include with your return. You must return the product to us in its original or equivalent packaging, prepay shipping charges and insure the shipment or accept the risk if the product is lost or damaged in shipment, which could void warranty coverage as customer-induced damage. We will return the repaired or replacement product to you. We will pay to ship the repaired or replaced product to you if you use an address in the United States (excluding Puerto Rico and U.S. possessions and territories) or in Canada (in respect of systems registered in Canada). Otherwise, we will ship the product to you freight collect.<br /><br /><strong>For Mail-in Service: Customer supplies box, Dell pays shipping:</strong> Upon a determination by Dell that your product should be returned to Dell for repair or replacement, shipping instructions will be provided to you. You must package the product in its original or equivalent packaging and call the carrier designated on your shipping instructions to arrange a pickup time or, at your convenience, you may take the adequately packaged product to a designated carrier pick up location. As long as you follow our shipping instructions, we will pay standard shipping charges for shipping the product in for repair and for shipping it back to you if you use an address in the United States (excluding Puerto Rico and U.S. possessions and territories) or in Canada (in respect of systems registered in Canada). Otherwise, we will ship the product to you freight collect.<br /><br /><strong>For Mail in Service: Dell supplies box and pays shipping:</strong> Upon a determination by Dell that your product should be returned to Dell for repair or replacement, packaging, shipping instructions and a prepaid shipping waybill will be sent to you. Upon receipt of the shipping supplies, you must package the product in the material required and call the carrier designated on your shipping instructions to arrange a pickup time. As long as you follow our shipping instructions, we will pay standard shipping charges for shipping the product in for repair and for shipping it back to you if you use an address in the United States (excluding Puerto Rico and U.S. possessions and territories) or in Canada (in respect of systems registered in Canada).  Otherwise, we will ship the product to you freight collect.<br /><br />When you contact us regarding certain products, we may offer to ship you a replacement product prior to receiving your original product back. In such instance, we may require a valid credit card number at the time you request a replacement product. We will not charge or invoice you for the replacement product as long as you return the original product to us within 10 days of your receipt of the replacement product and we confirm that your product issue is covered under this limited hardware warranty. If we do not receive your original product within 10 days, we will charge your credit card or invoice you for the then-current standard price for the product. If upon receipt of your original product, we determine that your product issue is not covered under this limited hardware warranty, you will be given the opportunity to return the replacement unit, at your sole expense, within 10 days from the date we contact you regarding the lack of coverage for your issue or we will charge to your credit card or invoice you the then-current standard price for the product. In addition, if you fail to pay Dell the amounts, Dell may suspend your limited hardware warranty support until the applicable amount is paid. A suspension of your limited hardware warranty for failure to properly return a product or to pay an amount charged for such failure to return a product will not toll the term of your limited hardware warranty and the limited hardware warranty will still expire in accordance with its original term.</p><p><b>NOTE: Before you ship the product(s) to us, make sure to back up the data on the hard drive(s) and any other storage device(s) in the product(s). You are responsible for removing any confidential, proprietary or personal information and removable media such as storage cards or devices, DVDs/CDs or PC Cards regardless of whether a technician is also providing in-home or onsite assistance.

In such instances, we may require a valid credit card number at the time you request a replacement part. We will not charge or invoice you for the replacement part as long as you return the original part to us within 10 days of your receipt of the replacement part. Failure to timely return the defective part to Dell in accordance with the written instructions provided with the replacement part may result in the suspension of your limited hardware warranty support or a charge to your credit card or invoice in the amount of the then-current standard Dell price for that part.

Both the performance of service and service response times depend upon the time of day your request is received by Dell, the service alternative you purchased, parts availability, geographical restrictions, weather conditions and the terms of this limited hardware warranty. An adult must be present at all times during the service technician's visit. You must grant the service technician full access to the system and (at no cost to Dell) have working space, electricity and a local telephone line. If these requirements are lacking, Dell is not obligated to provide service. In addition, Dell is not obligated to provide service if you fail to provide an environment that is conducive to computer repair, including for example, if you insist on service to be provided at varying locations, if you fail to properly restrain a pet, if you threaten our technician either verbally or physically, or if your location or the general area where the system is located is dangerous, infested with insects, rodents, pests, biohazards, human or animal excrement and/or chemicals as reasonably determined to be unsafe by our technician. If you or your authorized representative is not at the location when the service technician arrives, the service technician will not be able to service your system and you may be charged an additional amount for a follow-up service call.</p><p>If Dell determines that your system needs a replacement part, you authorize the on-site technician to act as your service agent to handle the delivery and return of the warranty parts necessary to render on-site repairs. You may incur a charge if you fail to allow the on-site technician to return nonworking/unused units/warranty parts to Dell.</p><p><strong>What if I purchased a service contract?</strong></p><p>If your service contract is with Dell, service will be provided to you under the terms of the service agreement.
